## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to create a card using HTML and styled with CSS. I used flexbox to center the main body as well as to center the QR code image and text blocks. I also used a media query to set the large screen width so that it is responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me with the finer details of using flexbox.
